  <p class="home_tag">I've been programing intensely for the past two years and recently finished a program at the Portland Code School. There I acted as mentor in the initial stages, but mostly I focused on making projects in, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript using OOP, test driven development, and agile methods. I got to solve difficult problems and to work with intelligent people. I'm excited to see my dream come as I look for a job as junior developer.</p>
