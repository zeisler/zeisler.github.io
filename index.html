  <p class="home_tag">I've been programing intensely for the past two years and recently finished a program at the Portland Code School. There I volunteered to mentor the incoming students and I focused on making projects in Ruby and JavaScript.  I'm excited about developing for the web and look forward to contributing to an innovative company. </p>
