  <p class="home_tag">I've been programing intensely for the past two years and recently finished a program at the Portland Code School. There I acted as mentor in the initial stages, but mostly I focused on making projects in Ruby on Rails and JavaScript using OOP, test driven development, and agile methods. I'm excited about developing for the web and  contributing value to an innovative company.</p>
