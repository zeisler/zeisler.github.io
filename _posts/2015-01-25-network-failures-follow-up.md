Here is an areal view of my wireless setup.

This cable is not malleable like normal cat5 cable so it made it harder to work with. I rolled off the amount I needed and crimped the ends so I could test before deploying the cable. It took a lot more force to crimp this cable and my cheap crimper wouldn't create a solid connection.

I had originally mounted the Nano Station around the tree and after two years the tree grew and the station was left hanging upside down. So instead I mounted it to a board and screwed that into the tree.

I climbed up the tree some 50ft with a cordless drill with the cat5 wrapped around my belt.
