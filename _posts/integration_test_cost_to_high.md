The sign of a good test is to pin point the place of failure so that it can be fixed. When an end-to-end test fails it could be any where in the stack and finding it where the error is can be difficult. 

Isolated tests

Test driven design puts presure to have less depenant and coupled code.
Integrated tests lead to poor design by putting no presure on depenant coupled code.

To test all interation of different objects and their different behaviour you would need to write an exponitial amount to test in insure a system without mistakes.

Solution: What Can we do differently?
