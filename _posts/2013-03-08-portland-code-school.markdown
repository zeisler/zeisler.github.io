I’ve been watching the rise of Dev Boot camps around the country, they offer a
fast pace approach to learning Web Development with a focus on mentorship and
networking with Employers. The problem has been these programs have been offered
in San Francisco, New York, and other bigger cities. 6 week, as most of them
are, is a long time to get the time off and even harder if I have to find some
place to live in a expensive city, like San Francisco. Then <a
href="http://portlandcodeschool.com">Portland Code School </a> popped in my
radar, its local, I don’t have to move anywhere and I can make connections with
employers in the place I want to work, Portland. I had the chance to meet Chuck
Vose the founder of the school at the Ruby Newbie event. He was very
approachable and willing to help me with my questions I had with the first rails
app I was building, <a href="https://github.com/ghzeisler/Timer">Timer</a>.

I have been programming since 2012 in C++ and PHP and am attending Portland
Community College. After getting a job with <a
href="http://northtechdefense.com">Northtech Defense</a> I started learning PHP
and MySQL and created an eCommerce and promotional site. This was my first
officially paying web job although I had done some other smaller jobs that were
just static based sites. PHP was very easy to learn because it has similar
syntax to C and almost everything is on the same level of abstraction, all you
need is a LAMP stack and html with embedded code or an included classes.
Resources like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> were great
when I needed to find a piece of code. It was like putting together puzzle
pieces although in the end the code was getting unmanageable. I had my logic and
persistent all in one level and then a view. I ended up doing some crazy things
not knowing how to properly query the database and just filtering it in with PHP
code. Since then I have learned so
much having to build my own user accounts with password hashing and how
to implement a shopping cart. All this to say after I was done I knew there was a
better way. A better model for design and also language that better
fit my brain and where I don't have to go look up function names all
the time because of inconsistent naming system. So that’s how I found Ruby.

I narrowed down my search for a new programming language to Python and Ruby.
What impressed me was the style of the language, it all looked very clean and
consistent. Python has similar attributes, but what really made me choose Ruby
was it’s community. First the quality of online tutorials are amazing, for
example <a href="http://codeschool.com">Code School</a> with their Twitter for
Zombies and also Michael Harl’s <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/">Ruby on
Rails Tutorial </a> are great resources. Then podcasts like <a
href="http://rubyrogues.com">Ruby Rogues</a> gave me great insight into the
community, there focus on test driven development and aspect of what it would be
like to work as a Rubyist.

I am passionate about learning to code and being apart of such a great
community. I am working on my application for the summer session starting June
3rd. I know this will be a great life changing opportunity for me and can’t wait
to get accepted and start the program.
