I have created a timer app in Ruby on rails, which is my first real rails app. The app is a one page app is use the [best in place gem](https://github.com/bernat/best_in_place) to edit the timer once its is created. To select the date and time I am using the jQuery UI [Date & Time picker ui](http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/). For the count down I am using a jQuery plugin from [Keith Wood](http://keith-wood.name/countdown.html) that will auto update if the date/time is changed.
