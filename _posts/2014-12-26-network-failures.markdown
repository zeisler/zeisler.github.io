Back in 2012 I set up a [long distance wireless connection](/2012/08/01/long-distance-wireless-network.html). Just recently it has been having some outages where it will out for day then come back for a few days this has been happening for the past few months. It hasn't realy been a problem because I am just tethering from my phone which has LTE and I can get 10mbps out in the country and I haven't had time to fix the issue. It became an issue when I wanted to buy a movie off of iTunes and had some friends coming over and it said it would take 10 hours to download. So we ended up watching another movie and had a great time but the gave me the modivation to get it up and working now.

The Nano Station is unreachable currently and I think the issue has is because of the cable I am using is not outdoor rated it's just basic cat5. I think I spent something like $30 on the cable and for that to last for 2 years I think I did ok, unless the station it's self is fried. I should of bought [Ubiquiti Networks Tough Cable Pro](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008L143VW/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_S_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=INA6JA5AT01J&coliid=I3JT18HKQCTOII) which is not only rated for weather proof but protected against [electrostatic discharge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic_discharge). I may also need a new [POE injector](http://www.amazon.com/Ubiquiti-POE-24-Power-Ethernet-24vdc/dp/B004EFHN66/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1419660372&sr=8-1&keywords=ubiquiti+poe+injector).

I think when I get this all working again I will upgrade the source cable connection speed from 20Mbps/4Mbps to 50Mbps/6Mbps that will give a nice boost in download speeds. This the top speed in my area no other options like Fiber Optics. I am interested in moving the next few years but realy want to stay out in the country just so happens that [Colton, OR](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Colton,+OR+97017) is all setup for fiber. [ColtonTel](http://www.colton.com/) will have fiber to the home, looking at there site I cannot tell if there package speed is upto date but it has yet to be turned on either.
