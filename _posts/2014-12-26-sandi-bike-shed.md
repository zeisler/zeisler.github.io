At work we are reading a chapter a week of Sandi Metz's book [Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby](http://www.poodr.com/). I am really enjoying it, I had started it a while back and didn't finish, but even rereading the first parts I am getting a lot more of it than before. There are a few things that I was already doing that probably came from other sources like blog post and Podcasts like ruby rouges. I recently heard a podcast from the folks at Thoughtbot called bike shed, in there [first episodee](http://bikeshed.fm/1) they talk about their experiences of trying to follow Metz's rules on a real client project as much as possible. I found it interesting to hear where it was hard to do and where they choose to break the rules and why. Also what long term effect of using those rules will have on a project. It's very worth a listen.
