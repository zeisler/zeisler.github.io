Working with the canvas api and angular I was able to add some user controls to manipulate the circle.
This was an experimental project so I could get familiar with HTML 5 canvas, I am really excited to work more with this api and see what I can do. I am interested in the future making graphs with this technology, I see it as great plugin free Flash although more base bones than flash with helper libraries it will be a better open standard.
