Learn how to refactor from a mutable object into an immutable one while still being able to make changes to state. 
Iâ€™ll start with an Account class and show how you would let it emit new objects instead of changing the previous one.
 I walk step by step through the refactor process and talk about its possible advantages.

{% highlight ruby %}
class Account
  attr_reader :name, :balance

  def initialize(balance:, name:)
    @balance = balance
    @name    = name
  end

  def deposited(amount)
    updated(balance: @balance + amount)
  end

  def withdrawn(amount)
    updated(balance: @balance - amount)
  end

  private

  def updated(balance: balance, name: name)
    Account.new(balance: balance, name: name)
  end
end

account = Account.new(balance: 100, name: "Checking")
account2 = account.deposited(100)
account3 = account2.withdrawn(99)
puts account.balance
puts account3.balance
