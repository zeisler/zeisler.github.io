Reaching to the top row to type a symbol or number seemed like too much
work. So I used a program called [KeyRemap4MacBook][keyremap] to overlay the symbols to the home row and numbers to the above row. To activate this I use the space bar as a modifier key.

{% highlight console %}
Overlay 1234567890-= to QWFPGJLUY;[]
arstdhneio' to !@#$%&amp;*()|
zxcvbkm,./ to []-_=+|{}
{% endhighlight %}

To use my setting replace or add to the private.xml file and them activate it.
