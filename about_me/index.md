I love to spend time with my family in Colton, OR. I mostly work remotely from my nice outdoor office overlooking our Oregon timbers.
I have a background in working with financial companies anywhere from designing investment benchmarking software to custom PACE underwriting software. 
I like to contribute to open source and create fun tools that improve productivity at work. I'm constantly looking to learn more about how to develop good software.
I practice test-driven development and really enjoy learning and teaching through pair programming. I've used a varied set of tools and languages, but Ruby is my favorite.
