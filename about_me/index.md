I love to spend time with my family in Colton, OR. I mostly work remotely from my nice outdoor office overlooking our Oregon timbers.
I have a background in working with financial companies anywhere from designing investment benchmarking software to custom PACE underwriting software. 
I like to contribute to open source and create fun tools that improve productivity at work. I'm constantly looking to learn more about how to develop good software.
I practice test-driven development and really enjoy learning and teaching through pair programming. I've used a varied set of tools and languages, but Ruby is my favorite.

<blockquote><p>Dustin is an exceptional developer who I offer my highest recommendation. While at SpendWell, he worked on several greenfield projects of significant complexity. His insight into design patterns and testing practices produced an architecture that is readily extendable, and a code base that embodies precision and clarity. Dustin took initiative to implement new test tooling that accelerated the entire teams velocity. He is also open minded about new technologies and readily learned several javascript tools in a short time. Finally, he is certifiably nice guy who is enjoyable to pair with.</p>
